# Axial

Axial is a single player game I made for 15-112, an is inspired by Ikaruga.

In Ikaruka there are two affinities - light and dark. Enemies come in both varieties, and by switching your ship between light and dark you can prevent damage or do double damage to opponents.

Similarly in Axial, you have the same mechanic. Sounds do no currently work on *NIX systems.

## Installation

Axial requires Python 2.7 and TKinter to run.
